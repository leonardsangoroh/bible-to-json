If you would like to contribute to a Bible who's language has not been added yet, feel free to create an issue. Once you have created an issue, one of the repository moderators will create a folder structure for you and you will be able to contribute.

## What next after requesting for a new language?
A repository moderator will create the respective requested language repository and close the issue.
